My robot arm is meant as a medical assistive device to be used at home by patients needing intravenous infusions. The device is stabilized on a four prong stand that would be positioned beside an IV bag pole. The medication would then be hooked up to the inner tubing, where a spiral tube would be utilized to reduce bubbling. A ball joint and elbow joint would connect the second part of the arm, which houses the programmable pump unit and screen, which allows the user to input instructions for medication administration. At the end of this part of the arm is a hand where the fingers house four different gauge needle catheters. The hand would be programmed to detect veins and initiate venous access before administering the attached medication.

During the modeling process, I somewhat changed the tubing section of the robotic arm into a flat curve with a central tubing system. The flat curve is meant to suck bubbles out of the moving medication while it is traveling through the central unit.

As I finalized my model, any changes I made were entirely for aesthetic purposes. I added edge loops to shape things the way I wanted them to be shaped and I also added some shapes to add structural integrity to the arm.

I UV mapped the finished model I had made, there isn't much to tell there. When it came to surfacing, I had some difficulties at first but then I realized I needed to layout my UVs better and once I did that, it made the substance painter much easier. I made the floor bits a rubber material while most of the body of the arm was a metal brush. One of the joints near where the medicine is pushed into the pump I made a carbon fiber material and the spiral tubing I made a bright orange painted color.

I designed a marine mammal that I named a Lenoira. They are native to a fantasy world I also designed and created called Elistria. They swim and hunt in pods of 10-15 and mate for life. They are predatory animals with thin narrow bodies and long tails. They have large pectoral fins that double as wings for jumping of the water to catch fish and steering fins on their tails, which also have a large flat paddle at the ends. Their ears are long and fluffy, using to detect their echolocation pings.

I used a YouTube tutorial to really try and understand some of the zbrush fundamentals. I designed the face shape and body shape first before adding in more details like fin flaps, eyes, nostrils, ears, etc. My biggest issue was figuring out how to smooth things down and not be lumpy, even with the smooth brush, and it still is a bit lumpy of a design.

I retopo'd my zbrush model to make it more low-poly and low resolution. I was able to figure out how to smooth the body down a bit in Maya via the retopo'ing but I still struggle a bit with that concept in zbrush, itself. I left the model mostly the same otherwise and I also went ahead and added the skeleton/joints for future rigging.
